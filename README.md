This is a simple events system in vanilla JS, which was created as part of a technical interview. It runs on a simple node server for demonstrative purposes. 

It also has a test suite written in mocha. 

To run the project, just type __node events.js__ in the terminal.

To run the tests, install mocha and type __mocha eventsSpec.js__ in the terminal.
